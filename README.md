Java Web app application with AWS CI\CD
This is my first project in my devops journey
First i create an AWS IAM account, also create EC2 instance with AMAZON LINUX, and generate a Keypair SSH Connection 
i aslo install maven and java on EC2 Instance
From i all create A github action while i install git on my VSCODE.
I spent total of 8 days to get this web app working
